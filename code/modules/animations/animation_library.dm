Taking a hint from goon, I thought I'd start our own animation library. These are stock animations you can use for anything.
Just make sure to add animations that you make here so that they may be re-used. Please document how the animation
functions so that other people won't have to wonder what it actually does.

This is something like a gun spin, where the user spins it in the hand.
Instead of being uniform, it starts out a littler slower, goes fast in the middle, then slows down again.
4 ticks * 5 = 2.0 seconds. Doesn't loop on default, and spins right.
