		<li class='tweak'>Guns will now fire bursts after using an attachment, if previously set to burst.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Sniper rifle is more likely to miss up close, so you are shooting your buddies less in the back. But it's very, very accurate as it travels far.</li>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>20 July 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Apophis775 updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Elevator times changed.  5 second travel time, 2 second spin-up time (from button to travel), 15 second delay once it arrives for loading/unloading.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>19 July 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Apophis775 updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscdel'>CL Escape pod removed.  Only escape pods are the ones on the upper deck near escape.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='soundadd'>New takeoff and landing sounds for the supply shuttle.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Available Cargo Technician jobs increased from 1 to 2.</li>

</div>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>18 July 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Apophis775 updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Ice Map Atmos fix (hopefully)</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Divide by Zero fixed (Overdose shouldn't insta-kill anymore)</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a problem with quick-clot.  Injectors only inject 3 unit, and it overdoses at 4 units.  Metabolizes at .1 unit a second.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed incorrect damage calculations on armor... What this means: armor will generally protect you a little better from FF and  other firearm related injury. It will also have a far higher chance of negating small arms fire (handguns/SMGs) the majority of  the time. Rifles and the like will still make you hurt, a lot. </li>
		<li class='wip'>Important: might be an issue with twohanding a gun, report any weird behavior asap so I can fix it!</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed xeno spits not messaging what they are when hitting marines.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some issues related to the ammo displaying caliber incorrectly.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed bullets flying away after hitting a hugger.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the heavy pulse rifle not having an ammo counter.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed burst firing missing a downed person after the initial bullet.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed double barreled shotties ejecting casings when fired.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed PMC radio. For real this time. </li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed flashlight light-related bugs with guns.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some missing back icons for guns and some other items. As well as some misc things.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the sadar and gl magstrap overlays.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed toggling xeno spit and getting lower firerate.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some typos.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a certain weapon blowback.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some overlay problems with special PMC helmets.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the attach GL launching grenades like a sniper rifle.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Some misc gun fixes and consistency tweaks.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sadar speed calculations.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>A bunch of efficiency changes related to the gun system. Probably won't be noticable too much in general, but will be noticable  during heavy firefights. It's pretty much as lag free at this point as it gets. Hopefully.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>I rewrote bipods since their functions were disabled with the gun update. They will work as follows: You activate attachment if  you want to get into a position to use the bipod. If it finds something, you will get a message. If you are already in a position  to shoot and keep that position, or it doesn't find anything, it will instead activate your other attachments. When you shoot and  you are not in the right position, the bipod will "deactivate" automatically and you can try and get into a new position. You have  to be facing the same way as you did when you established a position for the bipod, among other things. It should be fairly  logical. Bipods work with tables, racks, and metal barricades, though there may be a few others I'm not aware of. Should work fine  regardless. Bipods no longer provide bonuses at all unless they are used in a position, but firing them in position is very  beneficial.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked buckshot.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked slug speed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked sniper bullet speed.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked some distress equipment spawns.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked predator storage slots.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Rockets changed again. Explosive rockets will always explode on the tile of the clicked target. AP and WP rockets will always fly  straight unless shooting a downed person or some such. AP and WP rockets must hit the target to do any real damage.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Silencers will now give a different firing sound and hide muzzle flash. They now decrease damage a tad, but give increased  accuracy and less recoil. Not as great as recoil comp/extended though.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>16 July 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Apophis775 updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Nerfed hand-biting</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Resin Cuff time reduced</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Nest Escape Time reduced slightly</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjustment to Overdose damage so you can no longer overdose on so many chems you negate the OD damage and become a god among men.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>15 July 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='soundadd'>Emote update reworked to help prevent 'unusable emote' errors. Let Rahlzel know if there are any more issues with emotes!</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>Small bonus for Predators, including another new emote. Use *help or the Emotes verb to read about it.</li>
		<li class='soundadd'>New Queen-specific death rattle</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Lots of undocumented runtime error fixes this past week. Should help in the fight against server lag caused by errors filling up the server window and requiring a hard restart.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed RnD circuit imprinter and protolathe showing wrong designs</li>
		<li>Note: Defib recharging was disabled back in June without a changelog mention, so here it is to prevent confusion. Defibs are considered to be quite overpowered, so there is a limit to their usage (about 10 uses per defib - some of which will fail). Also, they cannot be recharged, so the ones you start with are all you have. However, we're still open to discussion regarding them and anything else on our forum. We're trying to find a difficult balance between the Xeno population regenerating and the human population continuing to wake up from cryo-sleep throughout the round.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>9 July 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Medbay access now required on cloner computer. Rules regarding cloner usage have been adjusted.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>2 July 2016</h2>

		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some issues with toggling gun verbs while not actually holding the gun.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Small fluff addition to survivors.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed M39 not having an ammo counter.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the weight class of a gun being improperly calculated when attaching things. Also fixed a few misc things with attach/detach and certain calculations.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked shotgun buckshot so that it looks and works like buckshot. Islugs also work a little different.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Fixed a ghost issue from a previous commit. Ghosts will now return to body properly.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class='author'>Rahlzel updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Admins/Mods: New "Fix Breach" verb in Debug tab that works like an RCD. Stand on the tile you want to add a floor or wall to and press it.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>1 July 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Change to smartdisc. You can catch it with either hand, regardless of what hand is active.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed bracer not exploding on a fallen comrade. Make sure to GRAB them first with your ACTIVE hand.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a few issues with claiming pred equipment.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed preds overspawning. Only three predators may Hunt. Elders are excluded. Preds may now spawn in other game modes, though only Colonial Marines support them right now.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Pred Elders actually spawn in the proper place now. This also fixes a misc issue with admins bypassing the pred whitelist entirely.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Removed xeno building stuff on huggers. You can still place huggers on top of stuff though.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Added back comms that were previously removed. This should fix all ert/special comm channels.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>29 June 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Bullets will no longer show up under the character's feet. Just a visual change.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the sadar smoke going in the wrong direction.</li>
		<li class='experiment'>Sadars and boiler bombs explode on the tile clicked on (if nothing gets in the way). Make sure you are a clicking a tile, not an object or mob or something on the tile. If you click a mob or object, the rocket will fly straight.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the cable coil not working on objects when you had the exact amount to do whatever with it.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed autolathe not giving back material when deconstructed.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed landing noise playing while in travel in space.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a carrier typo.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Probably fixed pred porter for real.</li>

	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>29 June 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscdel'>Removed F/Ctrl+F and G/Ctrl+G to cycle intents from the keybinds. You can already directly select intent with 1 2 3 4 on hotkey mode. Bind them to something more useful.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Added a cooldown to the grenade launcher so it can't be spammed in 2 seconds. You can also unload it now.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added a new belt that doesn't appear anywhere yet.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>28 June 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='rscadd'>Just so people are clear on how to reload the shotgun: Hold the SHOTGUN AMMO BOX with your hand. Use your OTHER HAND to CLICK on it. You will get a handful of ammo for your belt and such of 5 shells. You can reload with the HANDFUL only, NOT THE BOX. You can mix any type of shotgun ammo in the same shotgun, and you can transfer ammo from one handful to another (up to five max).</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>To macro your shotgun reload, macro ONE of these: .click Use-unique-action OR Unique-Action. The first one is more reliable and the one you should likely macro. Unique action is a catch all for firearms and their various unique functions, like spinning the revolver cylinder.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Revolvers cannot go IN the belt. They go in the BELT SLOT.</li>
		<li class='imageadd'>9mm extended mags now have an icon.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>28 June 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='tweak'>Replaced the lone supply crate Load Bearing Equipment with a regular webbing.</li>
		<li class='rscdel'>Removed an item from the map. It's still available in the hunter games, as is the regular version. A thousand samurai cried out in unison.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Tweaked tasers. They will fire off far more shots than last update and are ID locked for security use. Their stun timer has also increased just a bit to make arrests easier. You are welcome, MPs.</li>
		<li class='rscdel'>You can no longer switch restrictions on the smartgun. However, you can now shoot the DS and Iron Bears and hit them, pending tweaks when we have a new ID system.</li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div class='commit sansserif'>
	<h2 class='date'>27 June 2016</h2>
	<h3 class='author'>forwardslashN updated:</h3>
	<ul class='changes bgimages16'>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a boat load of problems with attachment overlays. They should fit far, far better.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed some missing ammo mags and minor graphical problems. Not everything though.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed snipers and burst fire. You cannot attach a burst fire assembly to the sniper now, as it won't work with the new burst  system.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a bug with guns not updating their icon when unloaded manually.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns not updating their icon when uloaded automatically through burstfire.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed empty states for several guns.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed attachments firing grenades/whatever when you removed them.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the powerpack ammo counter reporting 250/200 ammo.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the powerpack reporting negative ammo after reloading.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the flamethrower gas can and flame overlays.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed things like rockets or energy blasts bouncing off walls like a bullet.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed bullets getting stuck in mid air when fired from attachments. Might be more of these, report as they happen.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed burst fire. It will fire a quick burst of projectiles, then delay before firing again. Rate of fire should be about the  same.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed weird clicks from flame thrower attachment after each burst.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed switching attachments that can't be removed. They won't be removed anymore.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed the issue with the muzzle flash getting stuck on characters. It can still happen though, just very unlikely.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a rare issue with guns jamming. They still jam, but you will know when it happens, and you will be able to fire again  without having to reload it. Report if similar persist without any message.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sentries. Sentries won't shoot you if you have an ID in hand or in a pda, or both. Smartgun bullets still don't take this into consideration.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed attachment vendor restocking the wrong attachments.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sprites not updating when restocking vendors.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed accidental self incineration with the flamethrower.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed throwing weapons using the mag harness hitting people then coming back.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed a runtime(s) related to null ammo and something related to targeting. Sigh.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed an issue related to firing attachments and ammo types.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed an issue related to damage type.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed mags spawning with negative ammo because of reasons.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns giving a ton of error messages while wielded and then E'd to equip.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed xeno not properly doing burn damage.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns and ammo not having research levels set. They're all proper now.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed shotguns breaking on point blank.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed an issue with xeno spits barely doing any damage to turrets.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed guns firing on burst when dropped.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed issues with suicide with a gun and point blanking.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed/rewrote point blanking. Aside from not breaking anymore, it also takes into account all bonuses and never misses.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed rockets going into pockets/belts... Also fixed rocket launchers not taking the right ammo.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed sadars being able to fire on the Sully.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed tasers not going into charging ports. You can recharge them proper now.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed wooden barricades not being damaged by bullets or other projectiles.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed, I hope, preds not gibbing on death.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed buckshot hitting you, the shooter, when close enough.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed closet health and them getting destroyed with any sort of projectile. Like a taser.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Fixed rockets going into belts and such.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Regular magazine-fed guns now chamber rounds as they do in real life (those that actually do that). This change won't effect much, but you can now fire  off a mag and still have a bullet to fire in the chamber. Or reload with the chambered round. Every time you reload a mag, you  will cock the weapon if there's nothing chambered.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Attachments that you can fire will now tell you if they are empty or not.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>If you only have one attachment that can activate on your gun (ie, launcher/scope), you will auto select it istead of a menu.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Masterkey shotgun and any future attachables that use bullets can now make casings (if they are not caseless). You can also attach it to the pump shotty.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>You can now suicide with attachables, if they shoot bullets. Specifically the masterkey, but it also applies to anything else that is added in the future.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Masterkey shotgun now has 5 shots instead of 4.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Attached flamers now have a range of 5 tiles instead of 2.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Stocks now fit the A/2 rifle. No reason they shouldn't. Takes the same attachments as the regular MK2.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Elite M39s now take the same attachments as the regular version. Same reason.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Shotguns now have 25 shells per box, enough for five handfuls. There are also less boxes per vendor. All shotguns will accept handfuls of ammo, so it doesn't matter what box you got it from (keep clicking on the shotgun to reload shell by shell). You can also load different types of ammo into the shotgun, and it will fire them in sequence, starting with the last loaded.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Shotguns adjusted. Slugs behave like regular bullets, but do more damage (they had damage fallout before, losing damage as they  travelled) with good armor penetration. Buckshot has very short range, but it does massive damage up-close, and quickly loses  damage the more it travels.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Revolvers behave differently. You won't eject the mag when you run out of bullets. You will instead eject all the spent casings  and any bullets you have not fired (in the form of a handful) once you manually empty the gun. Once the revolver is empty, you may  reload it with a speedloader. You may instead reload it the revolver with a handful of ammo. You can also click a speedloader with  an empty hand to make a handful of ammo out of it. You may instead click a speedloader with a handful of ammo to reload it. You  can transfer ammo between handfuls of the same type, but you cannot mix them together for the sake of sanity. Unload (or click the  revolver with itself) to close the cylinder and fire. You can also spin the cylinder with use unique action if you want to play  Russian Roulette.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>All revolvers now fit the belt.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Smartgun will attempt to auto-reload roughly every 20 bullets fired. Any time you try to reload manually, this number will be  reset. If you stand still, you can constinuously fire until you run dry.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Smartgun now has a safety feature. Altclick it to toggle shooting any targets in your way or ignoring friendlies.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Renamed the M41A to M41A MK2. Just a cosmetic difference.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The Russian variant of the Korovin can take the same attachments and both are properly silenced.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some misc changes to a few guns in terms of attachments.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Guns now don't immediately tell you how much ammo they have upon examine unless they have an ammo counter, like the pulse rifle.  Smartguns are exempt.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added two new guns that are inaccesible for now.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>The replica katana is now a real weapon that is okay for real combat. Beware the samurai.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Finished implementing spent casings for guns that use them. This won't impact 95% of the game, but cool to have when the Bears  show up.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Minigun fixed and made significantly stronger. You have been warned.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Adjusted the muzzle flash to be a bit offset, to make it better looking.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Some guns won't automatically eject the mag. Mostly shotguns, revolvers, and a few misc guns not commonly available to marines.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Nerfed the merc shotgun to burstfire less.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Removed Russian guns from RO. Turns out you weren't supposed to have access to them.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Autolathes won't eat material for regular stacks of metal/glass. So you'll get the same number of mats back if you try to print  sheets.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>You can now burst fire right after reloading. You can also shoot grenades/flame/masterkey while the gun is empty or after  reloading.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>You can unload two handed weapons by holding them in your inactive hand then clicking them with your active hand. You'll take out  the mag.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Small predator weapon change.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Predators can shoot while cloaked. This is meant to incite terror and ward off enemies. Not to kill. If you abuse this, you will be removed.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Added muzzle flash to turrets.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Holy crap new projectile system! You actually have to aim now. Learn firing angles. Practice! You'll find all kinds of new guns, the pathfinding is much better, the system doesn't lag us out. Wow! See the forums for a bunch of posts about it. New ammo! New attachables! Holy shit! Someone should write a guide so I can belittle its ignorance.</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>Hunter Games gamemode! Yay! This is something we bring out once in a while to keep things fresh and let people blow off a little bit of steam. Might be a good idea to keep a no-name character handy to play there. Like the gamemode? Don't like it? Voice your opinions on the forum! The way Hunter Games works is, you ready up, get spawned into LV624 amidst a huge pile of random stuff. Then you fight it out until there's only one left standing! The last survivor has their name kept in the server logs forever. Glory!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Xeno HP has been nerfed slightly across the board. Some castes have had armor values increased to compensate, some had no HP nerf, and some got double whammied. Expect balance to be tweaked until I'm satisfied we can get maximum bloodshed from both teams. And don't fret, coming up next is the big xeno rewrite..</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Crushers lose a bit of stomp radius.</li>
		<li class='bugfix'>Bunch of cargo crates fixed with better stuff.</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Predators are losing hellhounds for now, but are gaining new cool upgrades for their bracers, including a universal translator and a sick new wristblade. Expect to see and play hellhounds in the Hunter Games!</li>
		<li class='tweak'>Way way more! If you find new bugs please post them on the forums.</li>

		<li>Observer improvements in "Ghost" tab:</li>
        <li class='rscadd'>New verb: Follow Xeno. Shows a list of living Xenos that are playing.</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Combined "Join as Larva" and "Join as Alien" into one verb: "Join as Xeno".</li>
        <li class='tweak'>Reduced maximum rejoin time from from 20 minutes to 10 minutes and reduced the minimum from 10 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Explanation: If you die in any form (or join as an Observer), you must wait for a 5 minute "death timer" (reduced from 10) before respawning as a Xeno. If a Xeno player leaves a living body (disconnect, ghost, etc), that body will begin an "away timer" for 5 minutes (also reduced from 10) before it is available for observers to join (they might reconnect). Therefore, the minimum and maximum time needed to wait before rejoining as an available Xeno is 5-10 minutes.
        <li class='rscadd'>Reminder for Admins: Spawned Larva using the Game Panel will immediately be ready for any observer to enter them (so long as their death timer is 5+ minutes). This can be useful for events and rewards for the Xeno team.</li>

		<li class='rscadd'>Distress calls are now available via the comms console, using a CO-level ID. It becomes available for use after at least an hour has passed, with a certain ratio of xenos to humans. Admins can also call it whenever. Distress calls aren't always helpful! Ghosts who are around when it is called can use Join Response Team to join it, but you have to be ghosted for a certain amount of time. It's probably very buggy as it's fairly complex code so please post on the forums if it breaks horribly (which it undoubtedly will).</li>

		<li class='tweak'>Players will no longer be forced into a chestbursting Xeno larva. If you have your preference to be a Xeno turned off, the only time you might be a Xeno is if the gamemode forces you to be one at round-start because it didn't find enough Xeno players. In order to become a Xeno after the round starts, you must have your Xeno candidacy enabled. This can be done at round-start by setting "Be Xeno" to "Yes", or by using Preferences > Toggle SpecialRole Candidacy > Xenomorph to "ON".</li>
		<li class='rscadd'>...However, infected hosts who have their Xeno candidacy turned OFF and there are no observer candidates to take control of the chestbursting larva (thus causing the host to stall chestbursting) will have a new challenge to contend with while the fully-grown larva sits in their chest cavity.</li>
